                      <p> The first week of the In-Person portion of the Bootcamp just came to an end! I learned and researched more in this week than I ever have in my entire life. I am so thankful for this opportunity and this has been a great week! I was nervous at first, but after getting into it I realized how comforting everyone is. They truly want us to succeed. I am excited for the next couple of weeks to come, but I know there are many challenges ahead.</p>

                      Something that held me back this week was my staying in a standard way of thinking. I have been taught that there's only one way of thinking since growing up and breaking free from this will take me further than I've been. 
                      I'm getting better at rewiring my brain into this new way of thinking to allow a free, clear and open mind so I can ensure my success.

                      I would like to learn more about data structures and Object-oriented Programming. I can feel the gap of knowledge from where I am with it
                      compared to where I want to be.

                      The In-Person part of the Bootcamp has been so eye opening to many different areas of my life. I didn't think about the relationships
                      that I would grow with everyone. I love the In-Person section better than the Remote, interacting with everyone, bouncing ideas around 
                      and having help in real-time.

                      <br />
                      
                      I've been thinking about this question for awhile. I come from a small town in Eastern, KY. where no one is expected to "win" in life or "get out". 
                      I watched everything and everyone around me growing up. I watched the people I wanted to be like, the people I didn't want to be like and I always
                      had a voice inside of me telling me that I was going to get out and make a successful life. In 2012, I started working at an Applebee's in Hazard, KY.
                      Two years later I became a Manager and moved to Huntington, WV. This was a moment that changed my life and set the trajectory for the rest of my life.
                      I worked for Applebee's until 2018 when I moved to Lexington, KY to take a position at J. Alexander's. I worked there for over three years and realized
                      that I was wasting my time living a life that I still wasn't proud of. I was "successful" by the term of many people from back home, but I still didn't 
                      feel like my success meant anything to me. I have always been interested in coding and the web. I'll never forget the "oo's and ahh's" from
                      creating fabulous MySpace pages that others envied. I found out about Awesome Inc. while driving downtown so I went to their website and the rest 
                      is history! I have no choice because I feel that my "Why" is now. I have been waiting my whole life for an opportunity to turn my life into something
                      that I want it to be and for the first time, I took a leap of faith to escape and break the barrier that was built around me from the start. This is my time.
