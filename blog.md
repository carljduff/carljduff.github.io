# Week One | Git & GitHub


<details>

<summary>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</summary>

<br />
  The first week of the bootcamp was a mix of what was expected and what wasn't. I came in with the mindset that there was going to be no room for error. After the first few days, I now feel comfortable that we're able to fail, not be judged and that it's part of the learning process. I enjoy the learn, build, and measure model that's being presented. I feel that I have had an adequate amount of time to learn the material, use the knowledge to build this blog and now I'm able to measure what I need to revisit or continue learning in order to be successful.

  <summary>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</summary>

  <br />
  I am excited to dig deeper into Web Development and lay a basic foundation of knowledge that I can build upon. I have a basic understand of HTML and CSS, but look forward to diving into Javascript! I am eager to learn about the backend of development to understand how everything works behind the scenes.

  <summary>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</summary>

  <br />
    I have never written a blog before, nor have I realized that I would enjoy it as much before starting this one. I look forward to updating it weekly so you can follow along with my journey. I am a deep-thinker, I have the ability to see every side of situations and I tend to live very peaceful in my own world.

  } else {
  console.log("Jordan will be sad! ðŸ˜¢"); 
  }
