##### _Follow along as I grow through my journey of becoming a Web Developer!_ 

# Week One | Git & GitHub


<details>

<summary>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</summary>

<br />
  The first week of the bootcamp was a mix of what was expected and what wasn't. I came in with the mindset that there was going to be no room for error. After the first few days, I now feel comfortable that we're able to fail, not be judged and that it's part of the learning process. I enjoy the learn, build, and measure model that's being presented. I feel that I have had an adequate amount of time to learn the material, use the knowledge to build this blog and now I'm able to measure what I need to revisit or continue learning in order to be successful.

  <summary>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</summary>

  <br />
  I am excited to dig deeper into Web Development and lay a basic foundation of knowledge that I can build upon. I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, but look forward to diving into Javascript! I am eager to learn about the backend of development to understand how everything works behind the scene.

  <summary>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</summary>

  <br />

    I have never written a blog before, nor have I realized that I would enjoy it as much before starting this one. I look forward to updating it weekly so you can follow along with my journey. I've had four jobs since I started working at 16. I was at my first job for two years, the second a year, the third eight years and my most recent job going on four years. During this bootcamp will be the first time I've not worked since I've been 16.

# Week Two | HTML & CSS

<details>

<summary>What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</summary>

<br />
I wish I had enough coding skills to code a simple game. I've always wanted to do this and cannot wait to be able to. I don't even care if it's a game as simple as snake.

<summary>What are you struggling with?</summary>

<br />
At the moment, I am struggling with remembering to commit while doing a project. I am also struggling with answering questions about git commands. I understand how to use them, what they do, and when to use them, but for some reason when I have to answer a question about them my mind goes blank. I'm going to work on this because maybe I'm missing a deeper understanding.

<summary>How do you solve a problem? </summary>

<br />
 I solve a problem by exhausting every resource. If I don't know how to do something I start by googling the topic, I skim through the top few websites and if it still doesn't clear up my understanding, I switch to YouTube. If I cannot understand something by reading about it, then I can normally understand it by hearing someone talk about it. I think I just had an a-ha! moment and realized I should start by hearing someone talk about the topic before reading about it. It could save me some time!

<summary>What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck? </summary>

<br />
 This sort of ties in to the question above, but I also want to add that a lot of times if I'm feeling stuck, I'll take a break. There have been many times when its clicked before I even came back!

  ```javascript 
  function webDev() {
  if (jordan === completeBootcamp) {
  console.log("Jordan will be a Web Developer!");
  } else {
  console.log("Jordan will be sad!"); 
  } 
  });
  ```
